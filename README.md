Setup Instructions (Windows)
Follow these steps to clone and run the project locally on a Windows machine:
1.	Clone the Repository:
Open Command Prompt or Git Bash and run:
2.	cd C:\Path\To\Your\Projects
3.	git clone https://github.com/heymishab/E-Hospitality.git
4.	cd E-Hospitality
5.	Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:
6.	python -m venv env
7.	.\env\Scripts\activate
You should see (env) in your terminal prompt.
8.	Install Dependencies:
Install required Python packages:
9.	pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt is unavailable, install Django:
pip install django
10.	Configure the Database:
o	By default, the project uses SQLite (no setup needed). To use PostgreSQL:
	Install PostgreSQL and create a database:
	psql -U postgres
	CREATE DATABASE e_hospital;
	Update settings.py (in the project directory) with your database credentials:
	DATABASES = {
	    'default': {
	        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
	        'NAME': 'e_hospital',
	        'USER': 'your_db_user',
	        'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
	        'HOST': 'localhost',
	        'PORT': '5432',
	    }
	}
11.	Apply Migrations:
Create and apply database migrations:
12.	python manage.py makemigrations
13.	python manage.py migrate
14.	Create a Superuser (for admin access):
15.	python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow prompts to set a username, email, and password.
16.	Run the Development Server:
Start the Django server:
17.	python manage.py runserver
Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in a web browser to view the application.
18.	Access the Admin Panel:
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and log in with your superuser credentials.
Usage
•	Homepage: Access the main interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
•	Patient Features: Register or log in to book appointments or view medical history.
•	Doctor Features: Log in to manage schedules and patient interactions.
•	Admin Features: Use the admin panel to manage users, appointments, and hospital data.
Troubleshooting
•	"No module named 'django'": Ensure the virtual environment is active and Django is installed (pip install django).
•	Database errors: Verify database settings in settings.py and ensure PostgreSQL is running if used.
•	Port conflicts: If runserver fails, try a different port:
•	python manage.py runserver 8001
